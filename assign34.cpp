/*A program in which you define two data structures: room and customer.
The fields for room should be: room_id, type (single, double, ...)
and price per night. The fields for customer should be: name, room_id
and number_of_nights. The program must ask the number of rooms and customers
from the user, allocate memory for them and read data for them. After reading
the data, the program must print a list which shows what room (room_id)
is occupied by what customer and display the customer information.
